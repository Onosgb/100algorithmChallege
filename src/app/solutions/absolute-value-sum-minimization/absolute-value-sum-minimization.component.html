<h2>Number One Challange</h2>
<p>

 Given a sorted array of interger x from a such that the volume of abs(a[0] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x) is the smallest possible
 (here abs denotes the absolute value) if there are several possible answers. output the smallest one.
 <br />
 Example <br />
For a = [2,4,7] the output sum minimization is = 4<br />
for a = [2,4,7,6] output is = 4;<br />
for a = [2,4,7,6,6] output is = 7<br />
for a = [2,4,7,6,6,8] output is = 7
<br />
 Hints.
 Math.floor();
